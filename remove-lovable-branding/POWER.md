# Remove Lovable Branding

## Overview

This power provides a systematic workflow for removing all traces of Lovable from React web applications created with Lovable. It helps you identify and remove:

- Visible "Lovable" text and branding
- Hidden comments and marks in code
- Meta tags and HTML identifiers
- Package.json references
- Any other traces that indicate the app was built with Lovable

The goal is to ensure no one can tell the web app was created using Lovable.

## Onboarding

### Prerequisites

- A React web application created with Lovable
- Code editor with search capabilities (VS Code, Cursor, etc.)
- Basic knowledge of React project structure
- Command-line access for running search commands

### What You'll Need

- Access to the entire project directory
- Ability to search across all files
- Permission to modify files (HTML, React components, package.json, etc.)

## Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: Complete Lovable Removal Process

This is the main workflow for removing all Lovable traces from your project.

**Step 1: Global Text Search**

Search for "lovable" (case-insensitive) across all files in your project.

**Using VS Code / Cursor:**
1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+F` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+F` (Mac)
2. Type: `lovable`
3. Enable case-insensitive search
4. Review all results

**Using Command Line:**
```bash
# Search for "lovable" in all files (case-insensitive)
grep -ri "lovable" .

# Or using ripgrep (faster)
rg -i "lovable"
```

**What to look for:**
- Comments: `<!-- Built with Lovable -->`, `// Created with Lovable`
- Text content: "Powered by Lovable", "Made with Lovable"
- URLs: Links to lovable.dev or lovable.ai
- Variable names or strings containing "lovable"

**Action:** Remove or replace all occurrences found.

---

**Step 2: Check HTML Files and index.html**

Specifically check your main HTML file (usually `index.html` or `public/index.html`).

**Common locations:**
- `public/index.html`
- `index.html`
- Any HTML template files

**What to check:**

1. **Meta tags:**
```html
<!-- Remove these if found -->
<meta name="generator" content="Lovable">
<meta name="created-with" content="Lovable">
<meta property="og:site_name" content="Lovable">
```

2. **Comments:**
```html
<!-- Built with Lovable -->
<!-- Generated by Lovable -->
<!-- https://lovable.dev -->
```

3. **Title and description:**
```html
<title>My App - Built with Lovable</title>
<meta name="description" content="... created with Lovable">
```

4. **Favicon or logo references:**
- Check if favicon links to Lovable assets
- Look for Lovable logos in `public/` folder
- The browser automatically loads `/favicon.ico` even if not explicitly referenced in HTML

**How to replace the favicon:**

```bash
# Delete the old Lovable favicon
rm public/favicon.ico
# or on Windows
del public\favicon.ico
```

Create a new favicon. Here's a simple SVG example:

```svg
<!-- public/favicon.svg -->
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 100">
  <rect width="100" height="100" fill="#2563eb"/>
  <text x="50" y="70" font-family="Arial, sans-serif" font-size="60" font-weight="bold" fill="white" text-anchor="middle">A</text>
</svg>
```

Add the favicon link to your `index.html` (inside `<head>`):

```html
<link rel="icon" type="image/svg+xml" href="/favicon.svg" />
```

**Note:** After replacing the favicon, you may need to hard refresh your browser (Ctrl+Shift+R or Ctrl+F5) or clear browser cache to see the new icon.

**Action:** Remove all Lovable-related meta tags, comments, and references, and replace the favicon.

---

**Step 3: Check React Components**

Search through all React component files (`.jsx`, `.tsx`, `.js`, `.ts`).

**Common locations:**
- `src/components/`
- `src/pages/`
- `src/App.jsx` or `src/App.tsx`
- Footer components
- Header components

**What to look for:**

1. **Comments in code:**
```jsx
// Generated by Lovable
/* Created with Lovable */
// https://lovable.dev
```

2. **Text content in JSX:**
```jsx
<footer>
  <p>Built with Lovable</p>
  <a href="https://lovable.dev">Powered by Lovable</a>
</footer>
```

3. **Component names:**
```jsx
// Check for components like:
<LovableBadge />
<PoweredByLovable />
```

4. **Import statements:**
```jsx
import { LovableComponent } from '@lovable/react';
```

**Action:** Remove all Lovable references, comments, and components.

---

**Step 4: Check package.json**

Open `package.json` and look for Lovable-related entries.

**What to check:**

1. **Dependencies:**
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@lovable/react": "^1.0.0",
    "lovable-ui": "^2.0.0"
  }
}
```

2. **DevDependencies:**
```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "@lovable/cli": "^1.0.0"
  }
}
```

3. **Scripts:**
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "lovable:build": "lovable build",
    "lovable:deploy": "lovable deploy"
  }
}
```

4. **Metadata:**
```json
{
  "name": "my-app-lovable",
  "description": "Built with Lovable",
  "author": "Lovable",
  "homepage": "https://lovable.dev"
}
```

**Action:** 
- Remove Lovable packages from dependencies (if not needed for functionality)
- Remove Lovable scripts
- Update name, description, author, and homepage fields
- Run `npm install` or `yarn install` after changes

---

**Step 5: Check CSS/Style Files**

Search through CSS, SCSS, or styled-components files.

**Common locations:**
- `src/styles/`
- `src/index.css`
- `src/App.css`
- Component-level CSS files

**What to look for:**

1. **Comments:**
```css
/* Lovable generated styles */
/* https://lovable.dev */
```

2. **Class names:**
```css
.lovable-container { }
.powered-by-lovable { }
```

3. **Content in pseudo-elements:**
```css
.footer::after {
  content: "Built with Lovable";
}
```

**Action:** Remove all Lovable-related comments and class names.

---

**Step 6: Check Configuration Files**

Look through project configuration files.

**Files to check:**
- `.env` or `.env.local`
- `vite.config.js` or `vite.config.ts`
- `tsconfig.json`
- `README.md`
- `.gitignore`
- Any CI/CD configuration files

**What to look for:**
- Environment variables: `VITE_LOVABLE_API_KEY`
- Comments referencing Lovable
- README content mentioning Lovable
- Build configuration comments

**Action:** Remove all Lovable references.

---

**Step 7: Check Public Assets**

Review files in the `public/` directory.

**What to check:**
- `robots.txt` - Check for Lovable-related comments
- `manifest.json` - Check name and description fields
- Favicon files - Ensure they're not Lovable logos
- Any image files with "lovable" in the name

**Action:** Remove or replace Lovable assets.

---

**Step 8: Final Verification**

Run a final comprehensive search to ensure nothing was missed.

**Verification checklist:**

```bash
# Search for "lovable" (case-insensitive)
rg -i "lovable"

# Search for common variations
rg -i "lovable\.dev"
rg -i "lovable\.ai"
rg -i "built with"
rg -i "powered by"
rg -i "generated by"
rg -i "created with"

# Check for hidden files
rg -i "lovable" --hidden
```

**Manual checks:**
- [ ] View the app in browser - check footer, header, about page
- [ ] Inspect page source (Ctrl+U) - look for meta tags and comments
- [ ] Check browser dev tools - look for console logs mentioning Lovable
- [ ] Review network tab - check for requests to lovable.dev domains
- [ ] Check all visible text on every page

**Action:** Address any remaining references found.

---

### Workflow 2: Quick Spot Check

For a faster check when you're confident most traces are removed.

**Quick search commands:**
```bash
# One-line search for all common patterns
rg -i "lovable|built with|powered by|generated by" --type-add 'web:*.{html,jsx,tsx,js,ts,css,json}' -t web
```

**Quick manual checks:**
1. Open `public/index.html` - scan for meta tags
2. Open `package.json` - scan dependencies
3. View app in browser - check footer
4. View page source - scan for comments

---

## Search Patterns Reference

### Regex Patterns for Advanced Search

Use these patterns for more thorough searching:

**Case-insensitive "lovable":**
```regex
[Ll][Oo][Vv][Aa][Bb][Ll][Ee]
```

**Common phrases:**
```regex
(built|made|created|powered|generated)\s+(with|by)\s+lovable
```

**URLs:**
```regex
https?:\/\/(www\.)?lovable\.(dev|ai|com)
```

**Meta tags:**
```regex
<meta[^>]*lovable[^>]*>
```

**Comments (HTML/JS/CSS):**
```regex
(<!--.*lovable.*-->|\/\/.*lovable.*|\/\*.*lovable.*\*\/)
```

### VS Code Search Settings

For comprehensive search in VS Code:

1. Open Search (Ctrl+Shift+F)
2. Enable:
   - Match Case: OFF (case-insensitive)
   - Match Whole Word: OFF
   - Use Regular Expression: ON (if using regex)
3. Files to include: `**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx,html,css,json,md}`
4. Files to exclude: `**/node_modules/**,**/dist/**,**/build/**`

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Can't Find All Occurrences

**Problem:** Manual search misses some references

**Solution:**
1. Use command-line tools (ripgrep or grep) for comprehensive search
2. Search with regex patterns (see Search Patterns Reference)
3. Check hidden files: `rg -i "lovable" --hidden`
4. Search in node_modules (if you suspect package names): `rg -i "lovable" node_modules/`

---

### Issue: Removing Package Breaks the App

**Problem:** Removing a Lovable package causes errors

**Solution:**
1. Identify what functionality the package provides
2. Find alternative packages or implement the functionality yourself
3. Update imports and component usage
4. Test thoroughly after replacement
5. If the package is critical and has no alternative, consider keeping it (it won't be visible to end users)

---

### Issue: Meta Tags Keep Reappearing

**Problem:** Meta tags return after build

**Solution:**
1. Check if your build tool is injecting them
2. Review `vite.config.js` or webpack config for HTML plugins
3. Check for HTML template files that might be regenerating content
4. Ensure you're editing the correct source file (not the build output)

---

### Issue: Comments in Minified Code

**Problem:** Comments appear in production build

**Solution:**
1. Ensure your build tool is configured to remove comments
2. For Vite: Check `vite.config.js` minification settings
3. For webpack: Ensure terser plugin is removing comments
4. Rebuild the production bundle after removing source comments

---

## Best Practices

- **Search thoroughly** - Use both GUI search and command-line tools
- **Check visible and hidden** - Don't forget comments, meta tags, and hidden elements
- **Test after removal** - Ensure the app still works correctly
- **Review production build** - Check the built/deployed version, not just source
- **Document changes** - Keep track of what you removed in case you need to reference it
- **Version control** - Commit before and after removal for easy rollback
- **Check all pages** - Don't just check the homepage, review all routes
- **Inspect browser source** - View the actual HTML served to users
- **Clear cache** - Clear browser cache to see fresh changes
- **Use case-insensitive search** - Catch "Lovable", "lovable", "LOVABLE", etc.
